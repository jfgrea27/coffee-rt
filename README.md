# coffee-rt

A very basic real time solution.

The idea of this repository is to create a minimal, monolithic solution to realtime computation without stream frameworks like Kafka.

I will then test scalability, reliability and other metrics.

This repository will be used as a point of reference for more robust solutions which have more frameworks.


## Left TODO

- Monitoring

- Deploy to cloud -> AWS?

- Testing
    - Scalability
    - Reliability
    - Performance
